name: Psychological Research Preregistration-Quantitative (aka PRP-QUANT) Template (PDF)
description: >
  As an international effort toward increasing psychology’s commitment to creating a stronger culture and practice of preregistration, a multi-society Preregistration Task Force* was formed, following the 2018 meeting of the German Psychological Society in Frankfurt, Germany. The Task Force created a detailed preregistration template that benefited from the APA JARS Quantitative Research guidelines, as well as a comprehensive review of many other preregistration templates. 
  The PRP_QUANT template ist available at PsychArchives (http://dx.doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.4463), in its current (and previous) version(s). There, the template can be downloaded as .xlsx (Microsoft Excel), .docx (Microsoft Word), .odt (Libre Office) or .ipynb (JupyterLab) file or it can be filled out online via https://forms.gle/9YgAoJn4ZYPXtHGk9 (a PDF will be automatically generated and sent via email).
  For more information about preregistration and the template in particular, we recommend watching the following webinar: http://bit.ly/PreRegWebinar (or browse the slides via the link under "related items" at PsychArchives). It shows the launch of the template on October 27, 2020, featuring two keynote speakers: Simine Vazire of University of Melbourne, and E. J. Wagenmakers of University of Amsterdam.
